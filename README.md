### <i>How to</i>
<p align="justify">
Test must be executed with this command from cmd <i>java -cp tests.jar org.testng.TestNG <b>PATH:\TO\</b>TakeAway\src\main\resources\xml_files\TestCase_01.xml</i>
Report file <i>ProjectDir/report/TestReport.html</i>

### <i>Automation Framework</i>
- [x] Config       - <i>Responsible for loading the configurations from properties files, Initializing the 
                     WebDriver, Implicit Waits, Extent Reports and also to create the object of FileInputStream 
                     which is responsible for pointing towards the file from which the data should be read.</i><br><br>
- [x] Utilities    - <i>Stores and handles the functions (The code which is repetitive in nature such as waits, actions, capturing 
                     screenshots, accessing excels, sending email etc.,) which can be commonly used across the entire framework. The 
                     reason behind creating utility class is to achieve reusability.</i><br><br>
- [x] Test Data    - <i>Stores all test variables that are used in tests. All the details which change as per the environment and 
                     authorization such as URL, Login Credentials are kept in separate classes. Keeping these details in a 
                     separate files makes easy to maintain.</i><br><br>
- [x] Test Scripts - <i>Creating test cases takes less effort because test scripts for different modules can be reused. There 
                     are two test method types. Those two types are responsible for front-end and back-end tests.</i><br><br> 
- [x] Test Cases   - <i>These classes contains @Test annotations used for calling test methods with different test values.</i><br><br>
- [x] TestNG       - <i>XML files that representing test suites that are created in test cases classes.</i><br><br>
 

<br><br><br> 
*****

### <i>Advantages</i>
- [x] Execute test suite that can be a combination between front-end and back-end test scenarios as a single test. 
      Framework structure supports full end to end testing (without performance and load). Extended framework 
      structure improves efficiency of every automated test. 
- [x] Test coverage and high code re-usability are improved by separated test methods. A single test scenario can be 
      re executed with multiple test data. This methodology reduces the number of test code required to test scenarios
      and data is easier to modify.  
- [x] Framework provides the fastest way to generate a test suite. Test methods that calls different actions like
      <i>login, get products list, place order, etc.</i> provides structure that requires less coding as it covers 
      all the possible combination of test scenarios.

<br><br><br>


#### <i>Build & Execute</i>

<p align="justify">
All in one means that the code for all tests is in one project. Combination between different tests and creating test 
compilations is possible by creating a new XML files witch should contains wanted test classes and test methods. Those 
XML must be stored in <code>src/main/resource/xml_file</code>. Specific test suite can be executed by changing the 
property value in <code>src/main/resource/config.properties</code>.
</p>

Run specific test suite:
1. Create XML file that must contains specific test methods.
2. Open _config.properties_ file and set the name of the XML file without any file extensions.
3. Run <code>/bin/build.sh</code> to compile your code.
4. Run <code>/bin/test.sh</code>.


*****

### Automation Report

<p align="justify">
Most important part for every automation is the report. By using ExtentReport and Log4j libraries we have very detailed 
report that contains only important information. <a href = report/TestReport.html>TestReport.html</a> provides all of the 
necessary details for the bussiness and QA's. Configuration methods are in <code>ExtentManager.class</code>.  . Every API 
test creates a file with JSON extension and store into it response from the server. 
This decision makes tests faster and separate reports for front-end from the back-end tests. More information about 
library can be found <a href = http://extentreports.com/docs/versions/3/java/#email-example>here</a>. Log events can be 
created by using <code>test</code> keyword.
</p>

Example:
```
//*** Create log event ***//
test.pass("Text");
``` 
</p>


#### <i>Report Functionality</i>
- [x]   REST/SOAP API request method, header and body details
        ([view](https://github.dxc.com/storage/user/52163/files/8a62a980-6386-11e9-9467-1561653f7117))

### [HttpClient](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/tutorial/html/index.html)
<p align="justify">
Http client is a transfer library. It resides on the client side, sends and receives Http messages. 
It provides up to date, feature-rich, and an efficient implementation which meets the recent HTTP standards.
An HTTP client is one of the easiest clients to create. It’s very handy because it 
allows for the calling, not only of the internal methods as the native protocol does, 
but also of third- party calls implemented in plugins that can be only called via HTTP.
I have chosen the Apache HttpComponents that is one of the most widely used libraries 
for executing HTTP calls. This library is available in the main Maven repository search.maven.org. 
To enable the compilation in your Maven pom.xml project just add the following code:
<code>org.apache.httpcomponentshttpclient4.5.2</code>
</p>

#### <i>Features</i>
- [x] HttpClient library implements all the available HTTP methods.
- [x] HttpClient library provides APIs to secure the requests using the Secure Socket Layer protocol.
- [x] Using HttpClient, you can establish connections using proxies.
- [x] You can authenticate connections using authentication schemes such as Basic, Digest, NTLMv1, NTLMv2, NTLM2 Session etc.
- [x] HttpClient library supports sending requests through multiple threads. It manages multiple connections established 
      from various threads using ClientConnectionPoolManager.
- [x] Using Apache HttpClient library, you can set connection timeouts.


#### <i>Development Steps</i>

<p align="justify">
The first step is to initialize the HTTP client object. This is done via the following code:
<code>HttpClient client = HttpClientBuilder.create().build();</code>
</p>

<p align="justify">
Custom headers allow for passing extra information to the server for executing a call. Some 
examples could be API keys, or hints about supported formats. A typical example is using gzip 
data compression over HTTP to reduce bandwidth usage. To do that, we can add a custom header to 
the call informing the server that our client accepts encoding: Accept-Encoding, gzip:
<code>post.addHeader("Accept-Encoding", "gzip");</code>
</p>

<p style = "line-height: 1.1">
After configuring the call with all the parameters, we can fire up the request:
<code>HttpResponse response = client.execute(post);</code>
</p>

<p style = "line-height: 1.1">
We can read the answer from the server:
</p>

```
HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity();
String responseEntity = EntityUtils.toString(entity, "UTF-8");
```

<p style = "line-height: 1.1">

### [OkHttpClient](https://square.github.io/okhttp/3.x/okhttp/okhttp3/OkHttpClient.html)
<p align="justify">
After latest implementations the project supports both libraries. Using OkHttp is easy. Its request/response API is 
designed with fluent builders and immutability. It supports both synchronous blocking calls and async calls with callbacks. 
OkHttp performs best when you create a single OkHttpClient instance and reuse it for all of your HTTP calls. This is 
because each client holds its own connection pool and thread pools. Reusing connections and threads reduces latency and 
saves memory. Conversely, creating a client for each request wastes resources on idle pools.
</p>

OkHttp is an HTTP client that’s efficient by default:

- [x] HTTP/2 support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket.
- [x] Connection pooling reduces request latency (if HTTP/2 isn’t available).
- [x] Transparent GZIP shrinks download sizes.
- [x] Response caching avoids the network completely for repeat requests.
- [x] Supports Android 5.0+ (API level 21+) and Java 8+.

#### <i>How To Generate JSON</i>

<p align="justify">
My recommendation is to use GSON Java JSON API from Google and JSON.org API.
<a href = https://github.com/google/gson> [GSON] </a>  is reasonably flexible and easy to use. 
<a href = https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java> [JSON.org] </a> was one of the first Java JSON APIs available out there. 
It is reasonably easy to use, but not as flexible or fast as the other JSON APIs.
</p>

<br>
<br>

[ GSON ]
```jshelllanguage
Example_1
JSONObject jsonPostData = new JSONObject();
        jsonPostData.put("deviceToken", "07304e56c452be73ad2b51a4647d0300");
        jsonPostData.put("platform", "Android");
        jsonPostData.put("platformVersion", "6.0");
        jsonPostData.put("appId", 1);
        jsonPostData.put("frameworkVersion", "1.0.0");
        jsonPostData.put("model", "LG Nexus 5X");
        jsonPostData.put("appVersion", "1.0.0");
        
        
Result:
{
  "appVersion": "1.0.0",
  "frameworkVersion": "1.0.0",
  "platformVersion": "6.0",
  "appId": 1,
  "model": "LG Nexus 5X",
  "platform": "Android",
  "deviceToken": "07304e56c452be73ad2b51a4647d0300"
}




Example_2
JSONObject uuid = new JSONObject();
        uuid.put("uuid", itemID);

        JSONArray items = new JSONArray();
        items.put(uuid);

        JSONObject jsonPostData = new JSONObject();
        jsonPostData.put("locationId", id);
        jsonPostData.put("items", items);

                
Result:        
{
  "locationId": 141,
  "items": [
          {
              "uuid": "28436bdc-374d-5d61-94a7-039f01ec9615"
          }
     ]
}




Example_3
JSONObject dataset = new JSONObject();
        dataset.put("genre_id", 1);
        dataset.put("genre_parent_id", JSONObject.NULL);
        dataset.put("genre_title", "International");
        // use the accumulate function to add to an existing value. The value
        // will now be converted to a list
        dataset.accumulate("genre_title", "Pop");
        // append to the key
        dataset.append("genre_title", "slow");
        dataset.put("genre_handle", "International");
        dataset.put("genre_color", "#CC3300");
 
        // get the json array for a string
        System.out.println(dataset.getJSONArray("genre_title"));
        // prints ["International","Pop","slow"]
 
        // increment a number by 1
        dataset.increment("genre_id");
 
        // quote a string allowing the json to be delivered within html
        System.out.println(JSONObject.quote(dataset.toString()));
        // prints
        // "{\"genre_color\":\"#CC3300\",\"genre_title\":[\"International\",\"Pop\",\"slow\"],
        // \"genre_handle\":\"International\",\"genre_parent_id\":null,\"genre_id\":2}"
    }
 
}

Result:
"{\"genre_color\":\"#CC3300\",\"genre_title\":[\"International\",\"Pop\",\"slow\"],\"genre_handle\":\"International\",\"genre_parent_id\":null,\"genre_id\":2}"
```

### Selenium
Environment allows to write automated tests that drive in a way similar to how a user would. At
this moment configuration supports parallel tests execution only on <i>Chrome</i> and <i>Firefox</i> browsers.
Browser configuration for now can is into `testng.xml` file.
